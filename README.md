# vatic
vatic is an online, interactive video annotation tool for computer vision research that crowdsources work to Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Our tool makes it easy to build massive, affordable video data sets. Written in Python + C + Javascript, vatic is free and open-source software.

This fork is based on modifications from [Sunil Bandla and Kristen Grauman's fork](http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/active-untrimmed/) and further allows for a number of free-form annotations to be made.
